Writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable comes down to the commenting of the code. Well commented code leads to a better understanding of what is written, not only to those who wish to use the code themselves, but the writer as well. Problems can be solved faster and be located with greater ease. Approaching these problems requires logical thinking all the time as the computer will only do what you tell it to, so errors will more likely than not be user based. This approach was different because I was working not only on the back end of software development, but on the front end as well. Computer scientists are a necessary part of daily life in today's day and age because everything we do runs off computers. So, if you want your computer to do something it doesn't already, you must hire someone who knows how to code to do it for you, which I think is extremely valuable today.
